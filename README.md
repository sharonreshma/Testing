Selenium WebDriver: Automate web interactions and perform UI testing.
Page Object Model (POM): Implement the POM design pattern for maintaining clean and scalable test code.
Reporting: Generate comprehensive test reports with TestNG's built-in reporting capabilities.
Cross-browser Testing: Execute tests across different browsers using Selenium WebDriver capabilities.
Parallel Execution: Run tests in parallel to optimize test suite execution time.

Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK)
Maven (for managing dependencies)
Selenium WebDriver
TestNG

Outcomes
he TestNG and Selenium Testing Framework provides a robust foundation for automating web application testing with ease and efficiency. By integrating TestNG's powerful testing capabilities with Selenium WebDriver's automation prowess, I was able to streamline and enhance the web application testing process.
